# MonthlySlip
A program that generates a monthly payment slip from the entered data. The source code (EmployeeMonthlySlip.java) and a runnable MonthlySlip.exe would be provided, although; the executable may be the inferior version. Just double click on MonthlySlip.bat to run the program, if using the source code, run the program on the IDE of the users' choice. 

<br /> Assumptions made:
1. Names must only be letters and hyphens
2. Slips are generated for the entirety of the month
3. Super rate is a double. A string can be used with superRate("%","") if the user wants to use %9.
4. Users may want to create multiple CSVs.
5. The user may want information at the end for clarity.

<br /> There are multiple versions of the program. One is an executable, one is java with a singular class (MonthlySlipSimple), one with encapsulation (MonthlySlip) and an AWS version. 

<br />Instructions on how to use the program:
1. Execute the program
2. Follow the prompts
3. A cvs would be generated in the end
4. type the character y to continue generating more cvs
5. type anything else without including the character y to terminate the program
